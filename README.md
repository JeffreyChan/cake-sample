# cake-sample
An example of using [CAKE](http://cakebuild.net/) to build .NET solutions.

The sample solution includes the following projects:

* Test project for the library
* Web application that uses the library

The build script illustrates common tasks on .NET builds, such as creating a NuGet package and publishing a web application to a local folder.
